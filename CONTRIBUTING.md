# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LoRA Easy Training. This guide outlines our development process and contribution standards.

## Ways to Contribute

### Bug Reports
Help us identify and resolve issues in the project.

**Submission Requirements:**
- Search existing issues before creating new reports
- Use provided issue templates when available
- Include environment details: GPU model, OS, Python version, training target
- Provide clear reproduction steps and expected vs actual behavior
- Attach relevant logs, screenshots, or error traces

### Feature Requests
Propose improvements and new functionality.

**Submission Guidelines:**
- Review existing issues and discussions for similar requests
- Clearly articulate the problem your feature solves
- Provide specific implementation details rather than vague descriptions
- Consider feature scope and project compatibility

### Code Contributions
Contribute directly to the codebase through pull requests.

**Priority Areas:**
- **User Interface**: Widget improvements and user experience enhancements
- **Calculation Tools**: Training parameter optimization and estimation
- **Dataset Management**: Upload workflows and tagging improvements
- **Performance**: Memory optimization and training speed improvements
- **Documentation**: Code documentation, user guides, and examples
- **Platform Support**: Cross-platform compatibility and GPU support
- **Advanced Features**: Optimizer implementations, scheduler support, and LoRA variants

## Development Process

### Getting Started
1. **Fork and Clone**: Create a personal fork and clone locally
2. **Branch Creation**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/dataset-validation`)
3. **Environment Setup**: Run `python installer.py` for development environment
4. **Development**: Implement changes following project conventions
5. **Testing**: Verify functionality and compatibility
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
7. **Pull Request**: Submit for review with clear description

### Code Standards

**Python Development Guidelines:**
- Follow PEP 8 coding standards with reasonable flexibility
- Include type hints for function parameters and return values
- Provide docstrings for public functions and classes
- Implement proper error handling with informative messages
- Use cross-platform file path operations (`os.path.join()`)

**Widget Development Standards:**
- Maintain consistency with existing user interface patterns
- Use clear, descriptive labels and help text
- Implement progress indicators for long-running operations
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Follow accessibility best practices

**Training Integration Requirements:**
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Consider memory constraints across different hardware configurations
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing configurations

## Testing Requirements

### Pre-Submission Testing
- **Functionality Verification**: Confirm intended behavior works correctly
- **Edge Case Testing**: Validate handling of boundary conditions and invalid inputs
- **Platform Testing**: Test across different operating systems when possible
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality remains unaffected

### Testing Procedures
- Fresh installation testing using `installer.py`
- Complete workflow testing: setup → dataset preparation → training
- Small dataset testing for rapid iteration
- Error condition testing with invalid or missing inputs

## Communication Standards

### Issue Discussions
- Maintain respectful and constructive communication
- Stay focused on technical topics relevant to the issue
- Provide context about use cases and requirements
- Be patient with response times from volunteer maintainers

### Pull Request Process
- Provide clear explanations of changes and their purpose
- Reference related issues using `Fixes #number` or `Related to #number`
- Respond constructively to code review feedback
- Update documentation to reflect behavioral changes

## Contribution Guidelines

### Acceptable Contributions
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- Feature implementations discussed in issues
- Documentation improvements and examples
- Test coverage enhancements
- Platform compatibility improvements

### Unacceptable Contributions
- Malicious or harmful code
- Copyright violations or unauthorized code usage
- Breaking changes without prior discussion and approval
- Spam, self-promotion, or off-topic content
- Duplicate work without coordination

## Recognition

Contributors receive:
- Attribution in project documentation and release notes
- Community recognition for significant contributions
- Maintainer consideration for sustained, high-quality contributions

## Support and Questions

### Getting Help
- **General Questions**: Use GitHub Discussions for project-related inquiries
