# üó∫Ô∏è LoRA Easy Training - Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines planned improvements and features for the LoRA Easy Training system. Items are organized by priority and development complexity.

## üéØ High Priority - User-Facing Features

### 1. Checkpoint Finetuning Support
**Status:** Planned  
**Impact:** High - Opens entirely new training paradigm

Add support for full model finetuning (modifying base model weights) in addition to current LoRA adapter training.

- **Implementation:** Leverage existing Kohya scripts (`sdxl_train.py`, `flux_train.py`, etc.)
- **New Features:** Different parameter widgets, memory profile adjustments, larger output handling
- **User Benefits:** Create custom base models instead of just adaptations
- **Challenges:** Higher VRAM requirements, longer training times, larger output files

### 2. LoRA Training Profiles  
**Status:** Research Phase  
**Impact:** High - Significantly improves user success rate

Curated, battle-tested training configurations based on community knowledge.

- **Research Sources:** Bmaltais Kohya GUI, Civitai community practices, successful LoRA creators
- **Profile Categories:** Character training, style training, concept learning, photorealism, anime/illustration
- **Implementation:** Pre-configured parameter sets with explanations and use case guidance
- **User Benefits:** Eliminate guesswork, proven configurations, faster setup

## üîß Medium Priority - Code Quality & UX

### 3. Training Manager Refactor
**Status:** Planned  
**Impact:** Medium - Developer experience and maintainability

Break down the 1500-line training manager into focused, maintainable components.

- **Proposed Structure:** 
  - `ModelDetector` - Model type detection and validation
  - `ConfigGenerator` - TOML generation and parameter mapping
  - `TrainingExecutor` - Process execution and monitoring
  - `ProfileManager` - Memory and training profile management
  - `OptimizerRegistry` - Optimizer and LyCORIS method configurations
- **Benefits:** Easier testing, clearer responsibilities, better code reuse

### 4. CSS Theming System
**Status:** Planned  
**Impact:** Medium - Professional appearance and consistency

Custom CSS themes for notebook widgets instead of relying on inconsistent Jupyter themes.

- **Theme Options:** Dark mode, light mode, minimal, cyberpunk
- **Features:** Consistent styling across environments, theme selector widget, automatic detection
- **Benefits:** Professional appearance, user choice, easier maintenance

## üîç Research & Improvement

### 5. Kohya/LyCORIS Settings Audit
**Status:** Ongoing  
**Impact:** Medium - Feature completeness and training quality

Comprehensive review of available settings to ensure feature parity with latest Kohya developments.

- **Research Areas:** New training arguments, advanced noise settings, memory optimizations, scheduler parameters
- **LyCORIS:** Algorithm-specific parameters, new methods, better defaults
- **Validation:** Improved parameter checking, better error messages, user guidance

### 6. Optimizer & Memory Efficiency
**Status:** Verification Needed  
**Impact:** Medium - Training accessibility and reliability

Ensure 8-bit optimizers and memory optimizations work correctly across environments.

- **Bits and Bytes:** Verify installation, CUDA compatibility, actual memory savings
- **Testing:** Container environments (VastAI, RunPod), different hardware configurations
- **Fallbacks:** Graceful degradation when optimizations unavailable

## üåê Platform Compatibility

### 7. ROCm Support (AMD GPU)
**Status:** Planned  
**Impact:** High - Expands user base significantly

Add support for AMD GPUs using ROCm instead of CUDA.

- **Implementation:** ROCm-specific installation paths, environment detection, memory management
- **Challenges:** Different APIs, optimizer compatibility, performance differences
- **Benefits:** Open training to AMD GPU users currently unable to use the system

### 8. Intel Arc Research
**Status:** Research Phase  
**Impact:** Low - Experimental platform support

Investigate Intel Arc GPU support options.

- **Option A:** Wait for Kohya to support Intel XPU (unlikely)
- **Option B:** Parallel HuggingFace-based training system (significant development)
- **Assessment:** Small user base, experimental drivers, significant implementation complexity
- **Priority:** Research only, implementation depends on user demand

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

### Error Handling Enhancement
**Status:** Under Review  
Implement structured exception handling with custom error classes for better debugging and user feedback.

### Model Detection Improvements  
**Status:** Under Review  
Enhanced model type detection using file headers instead of relying solely on filename patterns.

### Memory Profile Optimization
**Status:** Low Priority  
Current 4-profile system works well; expansion would add complexity without clear user benefit.
