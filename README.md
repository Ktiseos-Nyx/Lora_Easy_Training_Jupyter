## üåü Overview & Key Features

- **What is this project?** A user-friendly LoRA training system based on KohyaSS, powered by interactive Jupyter widgets. Instead of typing lengthy Python commands, you get helpful widgets that walk you through each step. Works on your own local computer or rented GPU servers.
- **Why use it?**
    - **üéì Beginner-friendly**: Helpful explanations and step-by-step guidance.
    - **üßÆ Training calculator**: Shows roughly how long training could take.
    - **üõ†Ô∏è Easy setup**: Works with VastAI, RunPod, and local computers.
    - **üìä Dataset tools**: Auto-tag images, upload files, manage captions.
    - **üöÄ Multiple architectures**: SDXL, SD 1.5 (production-ready), plus experimental Flux & SD3 support with various optimizers and LoRA types.

<details><summary>What You Need</summary>

- **GPU**: Nvidia (For built-in CUDA support) or AMD Cards for ROCm. (Future Support for ARC and otherwise coming)
- **Python**: Version 3.10+ (3.10.6 recommended for maximum compatibility)
- **Platform**: Windows or Linux based Operating Systems.
</details>

## üöÄ Quick Start (Installation & Setup)

Our trainer directly handles the task of installing major requirements depending on your environment.

- **Note for Cloud Users**: If you are on platforms like Vast.AI or RunPod, Jupyter is often launched automatically after your instance starts. You can usually proceed directly to the "Usage Guide" once your environment is ready.

<details><summary>üìã Installation Prerequisites</summary>

You will need Git and Python 3.10+.

**Check your Python version first:**

```bash
python --version
# Need: Python 3.10+ (3.10.6 recommended for maximum compatibility)
```

You can install Python 3.10.6 directly from Python's [main website here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/).

**Quick Git Check:**

```bash
git --version  # If this fails, install Git first
```

**Install Git if needed:**
- **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **Mac**: `xcode-select --install` in Terminal
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu/Debian)

</details>

**Main Installation Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter.git
cd Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter

# 1a. If you're running the Unified Branch (For Testing) Please continue with the following commands:
git branch
git checkout unified
git fetch origin unified

# 2. Run the installer (downloads ~10-15GB)
python ./installer.py

# Alternative for Mac/Linux:
chmod +x ./jupyter.sh && ./jupyter.sh
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### How to Launch Jupyter

(If Jupyter is NOT running)

```bash
jupyter notebook
# Or: jupyter lab
```

### Notebook Workflow

Your main workflow:
- `Dataset_Maker_Widget.ipynb` - Prepare images and captions
- `Unified_LoRA_Trainer.ipynb` - Train SDXL, SD 1.5, or experimental Flux/SD3 models
- `Utilities_Notebooks.ipynb` - Calculate optimal training parameters, Resize Lora & More.

<details><summary>üìä Data Ingestion Options</summary>

Options for getting data into the system:
- **URL/ZIP Download**: Download and extract datasets from URLs (e.g., Hugging Face, Civitai) or local ZIP files.
- **Direct Image Upload**: Upload individual images directly into your dataset folder.
- **Gallery-DL Scraper**: Utilize the advanced `gallery-dl` integration to scrape images and their tags from over 300 supported websites.

</details>

<details><summary>How to Get Model/VAE Links</summary>

To use custom models or VAEs, you need to provide a direct download link. Here‚Äôs how to find them on popular platforms:

#### From Civitai

**Method 1: Using the Model Version ID**

1.  Navigate to the model or VAE page.
2.  Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. If it includes `?modelVersionId=XXXXXX`, you can copy the entire URL and paste it directly into the widget.
3.  If you don't see this ID, try switching to a different version of the model and then back to your desired version. The ID should then appear in the URL.

**Method 2: Copying the Download Link**
Use this method if the model has only one version or if a version has multiple files.
1.  On the model or VAE page, scroll down to the "Files" section.
2.  Right-click the **Download** button for the file you want.
3.  Select "Copy Link Address" (or similar text) from the context menu.

#### From Hugging Face

**Method 1: Using the Repository URL**
1.  Go to the main page of the model or VAE repository you want to use.
2.  Copy the URL directly from your browser's address bar.

**Method 2: Copying the Direct File Link**
1.  Navigate to the "Files and versions" tab of the repository.
2.  Find the specific file you want to download.
3.  Click the **"..."** menu to the right of the file size, then right-click the "Download" link and copy the link address.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Support

**Known Issues & Compatibility**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Triton/ONNX Compatibility Warnings**: Docker/VastAI users may encounter issues with AdamW8bit optimizer.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NO SUPPORT FOR LOCAL MACINTOSH ARM/M1-M4 MACHINES**
- üêõ **FileUpload Widget Issues**: In some container environments, the file upload widget may not respond to file selection. **Workaround**: Use the manual upload buttons or direct file copying to dataset directories.
- üîß **CAME Optimizer Path Issues**: Due to container environment differences, you may need to manually edit the generated TOML config file. If training fails with "module 'LoraEasyCustomOptimizer' has no attribute 'CAME'", change `optimizer_type = "LoraEasyCustomOptimizer.CAME"` to `optimizer_type = "LoraEasyCustomOptimizer.came.CAME"` in your training config files.
