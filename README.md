## üåü Overview & Key Features

**Key Features:**
- Widget-based configuration interface
- Async based Uploading so your images don't become dreams.
- Integrated dataset preparation and tagging tools
- Training parameter calculator and optimization
- Multiple LoRA variants and optimizers
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Huggingface Uploads for datasets AND loras.
- Coming eventually when my brain lets me: FULL MODEL TRAINING! It's supported with KohyaSS, but our widget interface is a bit primitive and I need to understand more before bringing that in.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

> **We are STILL in heavy development. New features in theory SHOULD WORK, but are hard to catch.**
>
> This branch includes experimental features that are available in the Kohya backend but may not be fully tested in our setup:
> - üî¨ **FLUX training** - Available in Kohya, integration status unknown
> - üß¨ **SD3/SD3.5 training** - Available in Kohya, integration status unknown
> - üåü **Lumina2 training** - Available in Kohya, integration status unknown
> - üîß **Latest bug fixes** and performance improvements
> - ‚ö° **Enhanced upload widgets** (fixed cache issues)
> - ‚ö° **Language Cleanup** Cleaned up a lot of marketing speak and started the roadmap to check inconsistencies on missing content.
> **Note**: These experimental features exist in the underlying Kohya scripts but haven't been thoroughly tested with our widget system. Use at your own risk and expect possible issues. If they look like they're exposed in our widget setup, there is no saying if they current work due to our unified setup. We're working on fast trying to figure out how this works and get functionality quickly. If you have any issues please report them to the issues area.


## üöÄ Quick Start (Installation & Setup)

**What You Need**

- **GPU**: Nvidia (For built-in CUDA support) or AMD Cards for ROCm. (Future Support for ARC and otherwise coming)
- **Python**: Version 3.10+ required
- **Platform**: Windows or Linux based Operating Systems.
-
More details on installation can be found here [Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md) or in our [Installation Setup](docs/guides/installation.md).

You will need Git and Python 3.10+.
If you don't have python, you can install Python 3.10+ from Python's [main website here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Our set up prefers 3.10.6 at a minimum.

**Install Git if needed:**
- **Windows**: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- **Mac**: `xcode-select --install` in Terminal
- **Linux**: `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu/Debian)

**Main Installation Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter.git
cd Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter

# 2. Switch to the testing branch (recommended)
git checkout submodule-updates

# 3. Run the installer (downloads ~10-15GB)
python ./installer.py

# Alternative for Mac/Linux:
chmod +x ./jupyter.sh && ./jupyter.sh
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### How to Launch Jupyter

(If Jupyter is NOT running)

```bash
jupyter notebook
# Or: jupyter lab
```

### Notebook Workflow

The system uses three specialized notebooks:

- **`Dataset_Maker_Widget.ipynb`** - Prepare images and captions for training
- **`Unified_LoRA_Trainer.ipynb`** - Configure and execute LoRA training
- **`Utilities_Notebooks.ipynb`** - Calculate parameters and resize trained models

For detailed workflow instructions, see our [Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md) and [Notebook Workflow Guide](docs/guides/notebook-workflow.md).

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Support

For more help and support please check [Troubleshooting](docs/guides/troubleshooting.md) this has more comprehensive information. If you're a developer, we're working on our testing notebook, there is one in the wings of the /tests folder, but it has older code and may not match what is current running.

### üìã **Support Requirements**
Before asking for help, please review our [Support Guidelines](docs/guides/troubleshooting.md#support-guidelines--boundaries). We're happy to assist, but effective troubleshooting requires your participation - this means running the basic diagnostic commands and providing complete error information. Cherry-picking troubleshooting steps won't lead to solutions!

**Windows Users:** If you encounter Rust compilation errors during safetensors installation, this is not related to our notebook setup. It's a common Python packaging issue on Windows. Feel free to reach out on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/HhBSM9gBY) for assistance - we're happy to help guide you through the solution!

**Getting Help**:
    - ‚úÖ **Official Support**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter/issues) or [Our Discord](https://discord.gg/HhBSM9gBY)
    - ‚ùå **No Support**: Random discords, Reddit DMs, social media comments, etc.
    - üìö **Self-Help**: Check our comprehensive [docs/](https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter/tree/main/docs) folder first
    - üéØ **Submodule Issues**: Feel free to blame us on the original repos (kohya-ss, LyCORIS, etc.)!
