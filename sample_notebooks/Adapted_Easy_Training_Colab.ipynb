        "**What this cell does:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Clones the Repository:** Downloads the training scripts from [https://github.com/derrian-distro/LoRA_Easy_Training_scripts_Backend](https://github.com/derrian-distro/LoRA_Easy_Training_scripts_Backend) into a `trainer` directory.\n",
        "2.  **Runs Installation Script:** Executes `install.sh` (inside the `trainer` directory) to install Python packages using the *existing* Python environment's `pip`.\n",
        "3.  **Downloads WD Tagger:** Downloads a custom WD14 tagger script.\n",
        "4.  **Fixes Logging:** Uninstalls the `rich` library to prevent a logging issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Error Handling:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This cell is designed to handle errors gracefully. If *any* step fails, the installation process will stop, and a detailed error message will be displayed.  This is important to prevent further problems.  Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **`run_command` Function:**  This function (defined within the cell) is used to execute all shell commands (like `git clone`, `bash install.sh`, `aria2c`, `pip`).  If a command fails, `run_command` prints a detailed error message, including:\n",
        "    *   The command that failed.\n",
        "    *   The error code.\n",
        "    *   The standard output (if any).\n",
        "    *   The standard error (usually the most important part).\n",
        "*   **Early Exit:** If `run_command` detects an error, it returns `None`. The installation code checks for this `None` value after *every* command.  If an error is detected, the installation stops *immediately* to prevent cascading errors.\n",
        "*   **Final Error Message:** If any part of the installation fails, a final, user-friendly error message is printed, explaining that the installation failed and providing troubleshooting tips.  The script then exits (using `sys.exit(1)`).  This ensures you see the final message before the cell stops.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Troubleshooting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Read the Error Messages:** The most important thing is to *carefully read* the error messages.  They will provide clues about what went wrong.\n",
        "*   **Network Issues:** Many errors are caused by network problems.  Make sure you have a stable internet connection.\n",
        "*   **`install.sh` Problems:** If `install.sh` fails, there might be an issue with the dependencies or a conflict with pre-installed packages. The error message from `run_command` should provide details.\n",
        "*   **Git or Aria2 Issues:** Ensure they are preinstalled and working as intended.\n",
        "* **Missing files:** Ensure that `install.sh` and `installer.py` are present after cloning.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you encounter an error you can't resolve, please provide the *complete* error output when seeking assistance."

        "This cell is crucial for preparing your dataset for LoRA training. It automatically generates text descriptions (tags or captions) for each image.  These descriptions are saved in text files alongside your images and are used by the training process to learn the relationship between images and their content.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps and Options:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Tagging Method:**\n",
        "    *   **`anime`:** Choose this for anime, manga, or cartoon-style images.  It uses specialized taggers optimized for this type of art.\n",
        "    *   **`photo`:** Choose this for photographs or realistic images.  It uses a general-purpose image captioning method.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Anime Tagger Model (for `anime` method only):**\n",
        "    *   You'll be presented with a list of pre-defined anime tagger models (all from [SmilingWolf on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/SmilingWolf)).  These models are specifically trained to recognize common anime/manga features and styles.\n",
        "    *   You can choose a model from the list by entering its number. The default model (`SmilingWolf/wd-eva02-large-tagger-v3`) is generally a good choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Dataset Directory:**\n",
        "    *   Enter the name of the *subdirectory* inside the `trainer` directory where your images are located. This is the directory you specified in the previous cell (where you extracted your dataset).  For example, if you extracted your dataset to `trainer/mydataset`, you would enter `mydataset` here.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Caption File Extension:**\n",
        "    *   **`.txt`:**  A simple text file format. This is a common choice.\n",
        "    *   **`.caption`:** Another text file format, sometimes used for image captions.  Functionally, it's very similar to `.txt`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Optional Settings (Method-Specific):**\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **Anime Method (`anime`):**\n",
        "        *   **`blacklisted_tags`:**  Enter a comma-separated list of tags that you *don't* want the tagger to use.  For example, if you're training a LoRA for a specific character, you might blacklist general tags like `1girl`, `solo`, `standing`, etc., to force the tagger to focus on more specific features.\n",
        "        *   **`threshold`:**  This is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that controls the tagger's confidence level.  A *lower* threshold means the tagger will assign *more* tags, even if it's less certain. A *higher* threshold means fewer, but more confident, tags.  The best value depends on the model and your dataset, but the default (0.25) is a good starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **Photorealistic Method (`photo`):**\n",
        "        *   **`caption_min`:** The minimum number of words in the generated captions.\n",
        "        *   **`caption_max`:** The maximum number of words in the generated captions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Technical Details (and Why This Might Take a While):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **ONNX Runtime:** This cell installs the `onnxruntime` library.  ONNX Runtime is a high-performance inference engine for machine learning models.  Many of the taggers (especially the anime taggers) use ONNX models for faster processing. It may also install `onnxruntime-gpu`, if your docker is setup for it.\n",
        "*   **`fairscale` and `timm`:** These are additional Python libraries that are often required by image tagging and captioning models.\n",
        "*   **Dependencies:** The cell installs the `fairscale`, `timm` and a GPU enabled version of `onnxruntime` packages using `pip`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Troubleshooting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Make sure you've run the previous cells:** This cell depends on the previous cells (installation and dataset extraction) having completed successfully.\n",
        "*  **Dataset Not Found:** If you see an error saying the dataset directory doesn't exist, double-check the directory name you entered and make sure it's a subdirectory of `trainer`.\n",
        "* **\"No module named...\" errors:** If you see an error like `\"No module named 'onnxruntime'\"` or `\"No module named 'fairscale'\"` *after* the installation, try restarting the Jupyter kernel (Kernel -> Restart) and then running *only* this cell again. This can sometimes happen if the packages were installed but the kernel hasn't reloaded them.\n",
        "* **Tagging Taking a Long Time:** Tagging can be a slow process, especially for large datasets. Be patient! The time it takes depends on the number of images, the chosen method, and the model.\n",
        "* **Check for Errors:** Carefully review error messages in the cell.\n",
        "\n",

For example, if your dataset is in `trainer/mydataset`, you would enter `trainer/mydataset` here.\n",

        "*   **`full_bf16`:** Whether to use full bfloat16 precision. Usually, leave this `True` for best performance on modern GPUs.\n",
        "*   **`mixed_precision`:**  The mixed precision mode to use (`\"fp16\"` or `\"bf16\"`). `bf16` is generally recommended for modern GPUs.\n",
        "*   **`gradient_checkpointing`:**  A memory-saving technique that slows down training slightly.  It's generally recommended to leave this enabled (`True`) to reduce VRAM usage.\n",
        "*   **`seed`:**  A random seed for reproducibility. You can change this to get different training results with the same settings.\n",
        "*   **`max_token_length`:** The maximum length of the text prompts (captions) that will be used during training.  225 is a reasonable default.\n",
        "*   **`prior_loss_weight`:**  A parameter related to prior preservation loss.  The default (1.0) is usually fine.\n",
        "*   **`sdpa`:**  \"Scaled Dot Product Attention.\" A memory-efficient attention mechanism.  It's generally recommended to leave this enabled (`True`).\n",
        "*   **`max_train_epochs`:**  The maximum number of training epochs (passes through your entire dataset).  More epochs can potentially improve quality but also increase training time and risk overfitting. Start with 10-20 and adjust as needed.\n",
        "*   **`cache_latents`:**  Whether to cache latents (intermediate representations of images).  Can speed up training in later epochs but uses more disk space. Leave `True` for faster training if you have disk space.\n",
        "*   **`network_dim`, `network_alpha`:** These are key parameters for LoRA training. `network_dim` controls the size of the LoRA model (and its VRAM usage). `network_alpha` is a scaling factor.  `network_dim=8` and `network_alpha=4` are common starting values.  Increasing `network_dim` can potentially improve quality but increases VRAM usage.\n",
        "*   **`max_timestep`:** The maximum timestep for noise scheduling. The default (1000) is usually fine.\n",
        "*   **`ip_noise_gamma`, `multires_noise_iterations`, `multires_noise_discount`:** Noise-related parameters. The defaults are usually fine.\n",
        "*   **`lr_scheduler`:**  The learning rate scheduler. `\"cosine\"` is a common and effective choice.\n",
        "*   **`optimizer_type`:** The optimizer algorithm used for training. `\"LoraEasyCustomOptimizer.came.CAME\"` is a custom optimizer often used for LoRA training.\n",
        "*   **`lr_scheduler_type`:** The type of learning rate scheduler. `\"LoraEasyCustomOptimizer.RexAnnealingWarmRestarts.RexAnnealingWarmRestarts\"` is a custom scheduler.\n",
        "*   **`loss_type`:** The loss function used for training. `\"l2\"` (Mean Squared Error) is a common choice.\n",
        "*   **`learning_rate`, `unet_lr`, `text_encoder_lr`:**  The learning rates for different parts of the model. These are *very important* hyperparameters. The defaults (3e-05, 3e-05, 7e-06) are often a good starting point, but you may need to adjust them.  Experimentation is key.\n",
        "*   **`max_grad_norm`:**  Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients.  The default (1.0) is usually fine.\n",
        "*   **`lr_scheduler_args`, `optimizer_args`:**  Raw lists of arguments passed to the learning rate scheduler and optimizer.  You can usually leave these at their defaults unless you have specific advanced tuning requirements.\n",
        "*   **`output_dir`:** **VERY IMPORTANT!** Enter the *path to the output directory* where your trained LoRA model will be saved. This is usually a subdirectory within your project path (e.g., `trainer/Loras/Lora_Name/output`).\n",
        "*   **`output_name`:** The name you want to give to your trained LoRA model file (without the extension).\n",
        "*   **`save_precision`:**  The precision in which to save the LoRA model (`\"fp16\"` or `\"bf16\"`).  `\"bf16\"` is generally recommended for best quality and compatibility.\n",
        "*   **`save_model_as`:** The format to save the LoRA model as (`\"safetensors\"` or `\"ckpt\"`).  `\"safetensors\"` is generally recommended for security and safety.\n",
        "*   **`save_every_n_epochs`:**  How often (in epochs) to save intermediate LoRA models during training.  Saving every epoch (`1`) is common.\n",
        "*   **`save_toml`:** Whether to save the configuration to a `toml` file alongside the LoRA model. Recommended to leave as `True`.\n",
        "*   **`save_toml_location`:** The location to save the `toml` file, defaults to the `output_dir`.\n",
        "*   **`noise_offset`, `multires_noise_iterations`, `multires_noise_discount`:** Noise-related parameters. The defaults are usually fine.\n",
        "*   **`network_module`:**  The network module to use for LoRA training. `\"networks.lora\"` is the standard LoRA module.\n",

Make sure your dataset paths, model paths, learning rates, and other hyperparameters are set correctly. *Incorrect settings can lead to poor training results or errors!*\n",

        "\n",
        "1.  **Prompts for Configuration:**  You'll be prompted to enter various parameters for LoRA resizing, including:\n",
        "    *   **LoRA File Path:** The path to the LoRA file (`.safetensors` or `.ckpt`) that you want to resize.\n",
        "    *   **Output Directory (Optional):**  The directory where you want to save the resized LoRA. If you leave this blank, the resized LoRA will be saved in the same directory as the original LoRA.\n",
        "    *   **Output Name (Optional):** A custom name for the resized LoRA file. If you leave this blank, a default name (original name + \"_resized\") will be used.\n",
        "    *   **Save Precision:** The numerical precision to use when saving the resized LoRA (`fp16`, `bf16`, or `float`). `fp16` is usually sufficient and results in smaller files.\n",
        "    *   **New Dimensions (`dim`, `conv_dim`):**  The new dimensions for the LoRA.\n",
        "        *   **`dim` (Rank Dimension):**  This is the main dimension of the LoRA. Lowering it reduces file size and VRAM usage but *may* also slightly reduce quality.\n",
        "        *   **`conv_dim` (Convolution Dimension - LoCon-like networks only):** If your LoRA is a LoCon, LyCORIS, LoHa, or Lokr network (trained with convolution layers), you can also adjust the convolution dimension. Setting this to `0` disables conv_dim and only resizes the linear layers.\n",
        "    *   **Dynamic Resizing Options (`use_dynamic`, `dynamic_method`, `dynamic_param`):**  Advanced options for dynamically resizing the LoRA based on singular value decomposition (SVD).  Generally, you can leave `use_dynamic` as `False` unless you are experimenting with these advanced techniques.\n",
        "    *   **GPU/CPU Usage (`use_gpu`):**  Whether to use your GPU to accelerate the resizing process (recommended - leave as `True`).\n",
        "    *   **Verbose Printing (`verbose_printing`):** Whether to display detailed information during the resizing process.\n",
        "    *   **Layer Removal (`remove_conv_dims`, `remove_linear_dims`):** Advanced options to *remove* convolution or linear layers from the LoRA.  Use these *very cautiously* and only if you know what you're doing.\n",

        "\n",
        "4.  **Saves Resized LoRA:** Saves the resized LoRA model to the specified output directory and filename.\n",

        "*   **Experimentation:**  LoRA resizing is often an experimental process.  Try different `dim` and `conv_dim` values to find the best balance of file size and quality for your needs.\n",
