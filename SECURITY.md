# Security Policy

This document outlines our security practices and procedures for the LoRA Easy Training Jupyter project.

## Security Scope

### Critical Security Concerns
- **Code execution vulnerabilities**: Arbitrary command execution prevention
- **Malicious model downloads**: File validation and verification
- **Data exfiltration**: Protection of training datasets and API credentials  
- **Dependency integrity**: Package supply chain security
- **File system access**: Proper permission boundaries and path validation

### Out of Scope
- Theoretical attacks requiring physical machine access
- Vulnerabilities requiring manual code modification to exploit
- Issues affecting users who intentionally bypass safety mechanisms
- Local denial of service attacks against Jupyter server instances

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure Process
1. **Private Reporting**: Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Ktiseos-Nyx/Lora_Easy_Training_Jupyter/security/advisories/new) for confidential reporting
2. **Report Details**: Include vulnerability description, reproduction steps, and potential impact assessment
3. **Response Timeline**: Initial response within 48 hours, resolution target within 7 days
4. **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix implementation and testing

### Submission Guidelines
- Provide clear reproduction steps and environment details
- Include potential impact assessment and exploitation scenarios
- Submit uncertain findings - we prefer false positives over missed vulnerabilities

## Security Implementation

### Code Security Practices
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization of file paths, URL validation, and file extension verification
- **Safe Defaults**: No automatic script execution, minimal privilege requirements
- **Dependency Management**: Version pinning and regular security updates
- **Error Handling**: Information disclosure prevention in error messages

### Download Security Controls
- **URL Validation**: Verification of download sources against approved domains
- **File Integrity**: Extension and magic byte verification for downloaded content
- **Size Limiting**: Prevention of excessive resource consumption
- **External Scanning**: Integration recommendations for antivirus validation

### Credential Management
- **No Logging**: API keys and tokens excluded from log files and console output
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage practices for authentication tokens
- **Minimal Permissions**: Least-privilege principle for API access scopes

## System Architecture Security

### External Dependencies
The system downloads and executes content from external sources:
- **Hugging Face Models**: Community-contributed model files
- **Civitai Models**: Community model repository
- **GitHub Repositories**: Training script dependencies
- **PyPI Packages**: Python package dependencies via pip

### Code Execution Context
- **Training Scripts**: GPU-intensive Python script execution
- **Jupyter Environment**: Interactive code execution by design
- **System Commands**: Git operations, file extraction, and system validation

## User Security Responsibilities

### Environment Security
- Deploy on development/training systems, not production infrastructure
- Implement appropriate network isolation and firewall rules
- Maintain current system patches and Python versions
- Verify download sources and model authenticity
- Use multi-factor authentication for external service accounts

### Best Practices

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Use virtual environments
python -m venv lora_training
source lora_training/bin/activate

# Verify user permissions
whoami  # Should not return privileged user

# Maintain system updates
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade  # Linux
brew update && brew upgrade          # macOS
```

**Credential Management:**
```bash
# Environment variable storage
export HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"
export CIVITAI_TOKEN="your_token_here"

# Local environment files (excluded from version control)
echo "HF_TOKEN=your_token_here" >> .env
```

**Network Security:**
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Consider VPN usage on untrusted networks  
- Configure firewall rules for Jupyter server access

**File System Management:**
- Use dedicated directories for training activities
- Implement regular backup procedures for valuable training outputs
- Monitor and clean temporary file accumulation

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for:
- **Current Release**: Full security support and immediate updates
- **Previous Release**: Critical security fixes for 90 days
- **Legacy Versions**: No security support - upgrade recommended

## Threat Model

### Protected Against
- Malicious model files exploiting training processes
- Network-based attacks during file downloads
- Local privilege escalation through file operations
- Information disclosure through application logs

### Not Protected Against
- Advanced persistent threats with significant resources
- Physical access attacks on local systems
- Social engineering targeting user credentials
- Theoretical future cryptographic vulnerabilities

## Security Roadmap

### Current Development
- Enhanced input sanitization across all user interfaces
- Cryptographic verification for downloaded model files
- Process sandboxing for training execution
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning

### Future Considerations
- Hardware security module integration
- Advanced model integrity verification systems
- Enhanced isolation for training processes
